# ProzillaOS

ProzillaOS is a web operating system inspired by Ubuntu Linux and Windows made in React by Prozilla. It aims to function much like a real operating system, with the exception of running entirely on the web.

> Please note that ProzillaOS is far from complete and many additional features will be added in the future.

## Features

ProzillaOS will eventually have all the following features:

### Desktop

A desktop with a cool wallpaper is something every OS with a UI should have. The desktop will be a place where you can place shortcuts for your folders, files and apps.

### Fully functional taskbar

The taskbar will include a search feature, pinned applications, the current date and time and other common taskbar functionality.

### Applications

ProzillaOS will have a modular windows system that makes building applications a breeze. Each application will open a resizable window when opened, with common buttons like minimize, toggle fullscreen and exit. Every app will have its own functionality. Some examples of applications are File Explorer, Media Viewer, Terminal, Code Editor, Browser.

### Folders and files

File Explorer will let you explore, add and delete your folders and files. All of ProzillaOS' storage will be stored in local browser storage as JSON.

### Adjustable settings

The settings app will have options like changing the wallpaper, etc.

### Games

Yes, you read that right. ProzillaOS will have playable games. Initially, the only games will be [Prozilla's minigames](https://prozilla.dev/minigames/), but this can easily be expanded to feature more games in the future.
