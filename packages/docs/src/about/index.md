## About

ProzillaOS is a web-based operating system inspired by Ubuntu Linux and Windows made with React by [Prozilla](https://prozilla.dev/). It's a virtual desktop environment that mimics a real operating system and runs entirely in the browser.

## Open-source

ProzillaOS was made using React, Vite and TypeScript. The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Prozilla/ProzillaOS). You can contribute by finding bugs and suggesting features via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Prozilla/ProzillaOS/issues).
