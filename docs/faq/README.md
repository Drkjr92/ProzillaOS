# FAQ

## Q: What's the purpose of ProzillaOS?

A: Obviously ProzillaOS doesn't solve any issues or anything like that. It's just a fun project I started because I wanted to refine my web development and design skills, as well as my React.js proficiency. At the same time, I also wanted to create an interesting and innovative web application and share it with the community via open-source.

## Q: What tools did you use to make ProzillaOS?

A: I used Visual Studio Code for coding, Figma for designing, Notion for project management, GitHub for source control. I didn't use any libraries for the main parts of the OS. The libraries I used for specific purposes like certain applications or utilities, can be found in the `package.json` file. I got the icons from Font Awesome and the fonts from Google Fonts.

## Q: Is ProzillaOS free?

A: ProzillaOS is free and open-source. Check the [license](../../LICENSE.md) for more information about modifying and distributing ProzillaOS.

## Q: Why can't I install a certain program on ProzillaOS?

A: Because ProzillaOS is not a real operating system and does not use real applications. The available applications are custom React components, ProzillaOS can not interpret executable files or perform any task that it isn't programmed to do. However, there are plans for expanding ProzillaOS and enabling support for executable files and downloadable native extensions/applications.

## Q: Will you merge my pull request?

A: No, this is supposed to be a solo project. Despite the fact that I won't allow any contributions to this project, I encourage you to fork this project and create your own version. If you do so, don't hesitate to share it with me or with other people online!
