# FAQ

### Q: What's the purpose of ProzillaOS?

A: Obviously ProzillaOS doesn't solve any issues or anything like that. It's just a fun project I started because I wanted to refine my web development and design skills, as well as my React.js proficiency. At the same time, I also wanted to create an interesting and innovative web application and share it with the community via open source.

### Q: What tools did you use to make ProzillaOS?

A: I used Visual Studio Code for coding, Figma for designing, Notion for project management, GitHub for source control. I didn't use any libraries for the main parts of the OS. The libraries I used for specific purposes like certain applications or utilities, can be found in the `package.json` file. I got the icons from Font Awesome and the fonts from Google Fonts.
