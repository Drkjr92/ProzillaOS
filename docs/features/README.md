# Features

Most code for features can be found in the [features](../../src/features) directory. This directory is a library that is mostly used by files in the [components](../../src/components) and [hooks](../../src/hooks) directory.

> Note: Inside this part of the docs you will often see mentions of directories like `features` or `components`. These paths are relative to the `src` directory. The respective paths relative to the root of this project are `src/features` and `src/components`.
