# Features

Most code for features can be found in the [features](../../src/features) directory. This directory is a library that is mostly used by files in the [components](../../src/components) and [hooks](../../src/hooks) directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Mentions of directories inside this part of the documentation, are relative to the `src` folder.
